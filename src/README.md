A NativeScript plugin to easily deal with and detect which platform you are on. Since the original plugin requires a subscription now, this plugin is my attempt to maintain it to the point where it does not break.

This version is completely unsupported and untested on NativeScript 6.  Please upgrade your plugin to the tested, supported and maintained version. 

Documentation for this plugin is located at <a href="https://npm.proplugins.org/-/web/detail/@proplugins/nativescript-platform">here</a>
